    <h1>App Support</h1>
    <p>Thank you for using <strong>FengShui - Compass & FloorPlan</strong>. We are dedicated to providing a professional tool designed for Feng Shui practitioners, interior designers, and enthusiasts of Chinese metaphysics.</p>

    <h2>Product Overview</h2>
    <p>This app replaces traditional transparent plastic rulers (Li Ji Chi) used to analyze floor plans, bringing ancient wisdom to your iPhone. It allows you to overlay professional Feng Shui compasses on floor plans for precise analysis.</p>

    <h2>Key Features Guide</h2>

    <div class="feature">
        <h3>1. Professional Compasses</h3>
        <p>The app includes built-in templates for <strong>San Yuan, San He, and 24 Mountains</strong> rulers. The data is precise and rigorously verified to meet professional standards.</p>
        <p><em>Tip: Switch between different ruler styles using the menu in the main interface.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
        <h3>2. Floor Plan Overlay</h3>
        <p>Import floor plans, architectural drawings, or on-site photos directly from your gallery. You can overlay the compass on the background image to instantly analyze Qi flow and orientation.</p>
        <p><em>Tip: Tap "Select Image" to import a background. Use two fingers to zoom or rotate the image or the compass.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
        <h3>3. Traditional Aesthetics & Controls</h3>
        <p>Designed with a beautiful "Xuan Paper" texture and traditional seal-style UI elements. You can also freely adjust the <strong>transparency</strong> of the ruler to ensure the underlying floor plan remains clearly visible.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <h3>Q1: Why does the app need Photo Library access?</h3>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> The core feature of this app is "Floor Plan Overlay." We need access to your photo library so you can:<br>
    1. Import the floor plans or photos you want to analyze.<br>
    2. Save the final image (with the compass overlay) back to your gallery for your records.</p>

    <h3>Q2: How do I rotate and resize the compass?</h3>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> <br>
    - <strong>Rotate:</strong> Drag with one finger on the compass dial, or use a two-finger rotation gesture.<br>
    - <strong>Zoom:</strong> Use a two-finger pinch gesture to zoom the compass in or out to match the scale of your floor plan.</p>

    <h3>Q3: Will my data be saved if I change phones?</h3>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Currently, all data (including saved records) is stored locally on your device. If you delete the app or change devices, this local data may be lost. We strongly recommend saving important analysis results as images to your gallery. Cloud backup functionality is coming soon.</p>

    <h3>Q4: What if I find an error in the compass data?</h3>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> We strive for accuracy. If you notice any discrepancies in the data or markings, please contact us via the email below, and we will investigate and fix it promptly.</p>
