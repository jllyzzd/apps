    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 27, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>FengShui - Compass & FloorPlan</strong> ("the App"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>This App is a professional digital tool designed for Feng Shui practitioners and interior designers. We adhere to a strict <strong>data localization policy</strong>. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personally identifiable information or usage data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>To provide its core features, such as "Floor Plan Overlay" and "Save Analysis," the App requires the following system permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription):</strong> Used to import floor plans, architectural drawings, or on-site photos from your device's gallery to serve as the background for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Add Access (NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription):</strong> Used to save the final image (with the compass/ruler overlay) back to your photo library.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> We only access your photo library when you explicitly initiate an action (e.g., tapping "Select Image" or "Save Image"). All image processing, rendering, and compositing are performed locally on your device (within the iOS sandbox environment) and are never uploaded to any cloud server.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data generated by the App (including compass rotation angles, zoom levels, transparency settings, and saved records) is stored locally on your device (via iOS UserDefaults or the local file system).</p>
    <p>As cloud synchronization is not currently enabled, deleting the App or changing devices may result in the loss of this local data. We recommend saving important analysis results as images to your gallery.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We are committed to providing a clean, professional tool experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Ads:</strong> The App does not contain any third-party advertising SDKs.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not use any user behavior tracking or analytics tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our features (e.g., if we introduce cloud storage in the future). Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
