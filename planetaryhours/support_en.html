        <h3>What Are Planetary Hours?</h3>
        <p>Planetary hours are an ancient timekeeping system based on Chaldean astrology. Unlike conventional clock hours, planetary hours vary in length throughout the year:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daytime:</strong> Time from sunrise to sunset, divided into 12 equal planetary hours</li>
            <li><strong>Nighttime:</strong> Time from sunset to next sunrise, divided into 12 equal planetary hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planetary hours change daily based on the day of the week, local sunrise/sunset times, and your geographic location.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
        <h3>The Seven Classical Planets</h3>
        <p>Each planetary hour is ruled by one of the seven classical planets in Chaldean order (from slowest to fastest):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saturn (土星):</strong> Discipline, structure, limitations</li>
            <li><strong>Jupiter (木星):</strong> Expansion, wisdom, abundance</li>
            <li><strong>Mars (火星):</strong> Action, courage, conflict</li>
            <li><strong>Sun (太阳):</strong> Vitality, success, leadership</li>
            <li><strong>Venus (金星):</strong> Love, beauty, harmony</li>
            <li><strong>Mercury (水星):</strong> Communication, intellect, travel</li>
            <li><strong>Moon (月亮):</strong> Emotions, intuition, home</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
        <h3>How Planetary Hours Work</h3>
        <p>Each day of the week is ruled by a specific planet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunday = Sun</li>
            <li>Monday = Moon</li>
            <li>Tuesday = Mars</li>
            <li>Wednesday = Mercury</li>
            <li>Thursday = Jupiter</li>
            <li>Friday = Venus</li>
            <li>Saturday = Saturn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first planetary hour of each day is ruled by that day's planet. Subsequent hours follow the Chaldean order in cyclical pattern.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <h3>1. Why are planetary hours different from clock hours?</h3>
    <p>Planetary hours are based on the actual time between sunrise and sunset, which changes throughout the year. In summer, daytime planetary hours are longer than nighttime hours. In winter, the opposite is true. At the equinox, day and night hours are equal.</p>

    <h3>2. How does the app calculate sunrise and sunset times?</h3>
    <p>The app uses the Solar library (a high-precision astronomical calculation library) to calculate sunrise and sunset times based on your GPS coordinates and the current date. All calculations are performed locally on your device - no internet connection required.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I use the app without granting location permission?</h3>
    <p>Yes. If you deny location permission, the app will use Beijing (39.9042°N, 116.4074°E) as the default location. You can also manually select cities from the built-in city database without enabling GPS.</p>

    <h3>4. How do I save multiple locations?</h3>
    <p>Go to the Profile tab → tap "Locations" → tap the "+" button → search for a city or select from the list. You can save multiple locations and switch between them at any time.</p>

    <h3>5. What do I do if I'm in a polar region (polar day/night)?</h3>
    <p>In polar regions where the sun doesn't set or rise for extended periods, the app will display an error message: "The current location is experiencing polar day/night." This is because the Chaldean planetary hour system requires distinct sunrise and sunset times.</p>

    <h3>6. How do I change the language?</h3>
    <p>Go to the Profile tab → tap "Language" → select from 34 available languages. The app will remember your choice.</p>

    <h3>7. Does the app require an internet connection?</h3>
    <p>No. Planetary Hours is a completely offline app. All calculations are performed locally on your device, including astronomical calculations, location services (GPS), and data syncing with Widget and Apple Watch.</p>

    <h3>8. How accurate are the calculations?</h3>
    <p>The app uses the Solar library, which provides high-precision astronomical calculations. Sunrise/sunset times are typically accurate to within 1-2 minutes. Planetary hour divisions are calculated mathematically based on these times.</p>

    <h3>9. Can I customize notification sounds?</h3>
    <p>Notification sounds are managed by iOS. You can customize them in iOS Settings → Notifications → Planetary Hours.</p>

    <h3>10. Why does the Widget show different data from the app?</h3>
    <p>The Widget syncs data when it updates. If you change locations or color scheme in the main app, the Widget will update on the next refresh cycle. You can also force-refresh by removing and re-adding the Widget.</p>

    <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Notifications:</strong> Set notifications for important planetary hours to stay aware of energy transitions throughout the day</li>

        <li><strong>Save Frequently Used Locations:</strong> If you travel regularly or work in different cities, save these locations for quick access</li>
        <li><strong>Check Timeline:</strong> View the full 24-hour timeline to plan your day according to planetary energies</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Color Schemes:</strong> Try both Standard and Soft color schemes to see which you prefer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding Activity Categories</h2>
    <p>The Elect tab includes 9 activity categories based on electional astrology principles:</p>
