    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 12, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Planetary Hours</strong> ("the App"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App is a standalone astrology utility tool. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information, usage data, or device information to external servers.</p>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>The App requires location access to calculate accurate planetary hours based on sunrise and sunset times for your specific location.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All location data is processed locally on your device. The App uses GPS positioning or your saved city selection to calculate planetary hours.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> Your location information is NOT transmitted to any server. All calculations are performed entirely offline on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Saved Locations:</strong> You can save multiple locations (such as home, work, or travel destinations) in the App. These locations are stored locally on your device using SwiftData and are never transmitted to any server.</li>
        <li><strong>Default Location:</strong> If location permission is denied, the App uses Beijing (39.9042°N, 116.4074°E) as the default location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notification Data</h3>
    <p>The App can send local notifications to remind you when a planetary hour begins or ends.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Notifications Only:</strong> All notifications are scheduled and delivered locally by iOS on your device. No notification content is sent to any server.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can enable or disable notifications at any time in the App settings. You can choose which planetary hours to receive notifications for.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores minimal user preference data on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Saved Locations:</strong> Locations you save (city name, latitude, longitude) are stored locally via SwiftData</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Color scheme preference (standard/soft), notification settings, and language preference are stored locally via iOS UserDefaults</li>
        <li><strong>Widget Data:</strong> Current location and color scheme are shared with the Widget extension via App Group (group.com.yourcompany.planethour) - this data remains on your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device solely to enhance your user experience. We do not have access to this data.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following system permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Permission (When In Use):</strong> Required to calculate accurate sunrise/sunset times and planetary hours for your current location. You can deny this permission and use the App with saved cities or the default location (Beijing).</li>
        <li><strong>Notification Permission:</strong> Optional. Required if you want to receive reminders when planetary hours begin or end. The App works fully without this permission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The App does NOT require: Camera, Microphone, Contacts, Photos, or any other permissions.</p>

    <h2>4. Multi-Language Support</h2>
