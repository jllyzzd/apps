    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Percent - Percentage Calculator</strong> ("the App"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>1. We Collect No Data</h2>
    <p>The App is a standalone utility tool. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information, usage data, or device information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Accounts:</strong> You do not need to register or log in to use any features of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>No Trackers:</strong> We do not use any third-party advertising SDKs or user behavior analytics trackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All percentage calculations (including basic calculation, increase/decrease calculation, comparison calculation, ratio calculation, and reverse calculation) are performed locally on your device. No data is sent to any server.</li>
        <li><strong>No Internet Required:</strong> The App does not require an internet connection to function. All calculations and features work completely offline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App may store minimal user preference data on your device (such as your selected interface language and last used calculation type). This data is stored locally (via iOS UserDefaults) solely to enhance your user experience. We do not have access to this data.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App does not require any special system permissions (such as Camera, Location, Microphone, Contacts, etc.) to function. The App only uses basic system functionality to display the interface and perform calculations.</p>

    <h2>4. Multi-Language Support</h2>
    <p>The App supports 32 languages. Your language preference is stored only on your local device and is not sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no collection or processing of children's privacy data.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Although significant changes are unlikely, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
